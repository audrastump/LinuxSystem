Answer the studio 17 questions here.
2) 
We tested read, write, append, getSize and getName
We created a new ImageFile of { 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X','X', 'X', '3' }; This constructed an image file named "test"
of size 3x3 via the write function. 
We texted getSize() which returned 9 and getName() returned test. The read function outputted the characters in the 3x3 grid. 
Append did not work as predicted since this is an image. 
3) 
Interface allows us to create implementations for the derived classes. Also, this allows it to be easily modified since the
base class is declared virtual. Finally, the data is encapsulated to protect privacy of data. 

4) We would need to add an if statement to determine the extension for mp3. We would then call the constructor for the mp3 
file, similar to how we did for image file and text files. 

5) Unit tests pass
